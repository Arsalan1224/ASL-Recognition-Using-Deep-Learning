# ASL-Recognition-Using-Deep-Learning
This repository contains the code and resources for an American Sign Language (ASL) recognition project using deep learning. The project involves developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Keras to classify images of ASL gestures. Key components of the project include:

1) Data Visualization: Exploring and understanding the dataset through visualizations.
2) Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
3) Model Training: Building and training a CNN to accurately recognize ASL gestures.
4) Performance Improvement: Enhancing model accuracy by analyzing and addressing incorrect predictions.
5) Real-Time Detection: Implementing OpenCV for capturing and processing live video to recognize ASL gestures in real-time.

In the video, 3 alphabets are detected using CNN model. The alphabets are "O","L" and "H"
